# Knowledge Base

This document provides foundational knowledge about game engines in general and specific details about this Python-based game engine.

## 1. What is a Game Engine?

A game engine is a software development environment designed for people to build video games. It provides a suite of tools and functionalities to simplify the development process, allowing creators to focus on the unique aspects of their game rather than reinventing core systems. Think of it as a workshop equipped with all the necessary tools to build a game.

## 2. Core Components of a Game Engine

Most game engines, whether 2D or 3D, share a set of common core components:

*   **Game Loop:** The heart of the engine. It's an infinite loop that processes user input, updates game state, and renders the game. It ensures the game runs smoothly and consistently.
*   **Renderer:** Responsible for drawing everything you see on the screen. This includes 2D sprites, 3D models, lighting, shadows, and visual effects.
*   **Input System:** Handles input from various devices like keyboards, mice, gamepads, and touch screens. It translates player actions into game commands.
*   **Scene Graph/Manager:** Organizes all the objects (characters, props, cameras, lights) within a game world or level. It defines their relationships and facilitates efficient rendering and updates.
*   **Asset Manager:** Manages game assets such as images, sounds, 3D models, scripts, and fonts. It handles loading, unloading, and accessing these resources.
*   **Physics Engine:** Simulates physical interactions like gravity, collisions, and forces. This component makes game worlds feel more realistic and interactive.
*   **Scripting System:** Allows developers to define game logic, character behaviors, and event handling using a programming or scripting language.

## 3. 2D vs. 3D Game Engines

The primary differences lie in how they handle graphics, mathematics, and spatial representation:

*   **2D Engines:**
    *   Operate in a two-dimensional space (X and Y axes).
    *   Typically use sprites (2D images) for characters and objects.
    *   Simpler rendering pipeline and mathematical calculations (e.g., 2D vector math, simple collision detection).
    *   Examples: Platformers, top-down RPGs, puzzle games.
*   **3D Engines:**
    *   Operate in a three-dimensional space (X, Y, and Z axes).
    *   Use 3D models (meshes with textures) for characters and objects.
    *   More complex rendering pipeline (e.g., perspective projection, lighting, shaders) and mathematical calculations (e.g., 3D vector math, quaternions, complex collision detection).
    *   Examples: First-person shooters, open-world adventures, simulations.

This engine aims to support both 2D and 3D game development, providing appropriate tools and abstractions for each.

## 4. Why Python?

Python is chosen for this engine primarily for:

*   **Rapid Prototyping and Ease of Use:** Python's simple syntax and extensive standard library allow for quick development cycles and make it accessible to beginners.
*   **Rich Ecosystem:** A vast number of third-party libraries are available for various tasks, including scientific computing, image processing, and networking.
*   **Scripting Flexibility:** Python excels as a scripting language, making it ideal for defining game logic and behavior.
*   **Educational Value:** It's a popular language for teaching programming concepts.

While Python is not traditionally known for high-performance game development due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and its interpreted nature, these concerns can be mitigated by:
*   Offloading performance-critical tasks (like rendering and physics) to optimized C/C++ libraries (via bindings).
*   Careful algorithm design and data structures.
*   Focusing on game types that are less demanding on raw processing power, or where Python's development speed outweighs performance overhead for specific use cases.

## 5. Planned Architecture and Design Goals

*   **Architecture:**
    *   **Layered Architecture:** Core engine functionalities will be separated from higher-level game logic and tools.
    *   **Entity-Component-System (ECS) (Consideration):** Exploring ECS as a potential pattern for managing game objects and their behaviors, promoting flexibility and data-oriented design.
    *   **Event-Driven:** Many interactions within the engine will be handled through an event system.
*   **Design Goals:**
    *   **Modularity:** Core systems should be loosely coupled, allowing developers to use only the parts they need or replace components easily.
    *   **Extensibility:** Easy to add new features, support new platforms, or integrate custom tools.
    *   **Ease of Use:** Intuitive API and clear documentation to lower the barrier to entry for game development.
    *   **Performance (where it matters):** While Python is the primary language, performance-critical sections will leverage optimized libraries or potentially C/C++ extensions.
    *   **Cross-Platform (Goal):** Aim to support major desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).

## 6. Modularity and Open-Source Nature

*   **Modularity:**
    *   The engine will be designed with distinct modules (e.g., `Renderer`, `Input`, `Physics`, `SceneManager`).
    *   Each module will have a well-defined API, allowing them to be used independently or replaced with custom implementations.
    *   This approach facilitates easier maintenance, testing, and contribution.
*   **Open-Source:**
    *   The engine will be developed under a permissive open-source license (e.g., MIT or Apache 2.0).
    *   This encourages community contributions, transparency, and allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the engine freely.
    *   Source code will be publicly available (e.g., on GitHub).
    *   Community involvement in design discussions, bug reporting, and feature development will be welcomed.

## 7. Potential External Libraries

The engine plans to leverage several powerful Python libraries:

*   **PyOpenGL:** For low-level access to OpenGL, enabling hardware-accelerated 2D and 3D rendering.
*   **Pygame:** Potentially for window creation, event handling, input, and 2D graphics utilities (especially for simpler 2D games or as a fallback). Its SDL bindings are valuable.
*   **NumPy:** For efficient numerical operations, crucial for graphics, physics, and other mathematical computations.
*   **Pyglet:** Another alternative for windowing, multimedia, and OpenGL context management.
*   **pybullet:** For advanced 3D physics simulation, including collision detection, rigid body dynamics, and robotics.
*   **Pillow (PIL Fork):** For image loading, manipulation, and processing.
*   **Dear PyGui / ImGui bindings:** For creating editor tools and in-game user interfaces.

The choice of specific libraries may evolve as development progresses, prioritizing flexibility, performance, and community support.
